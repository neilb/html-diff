0.56, November 7, 2006:
    * In build process, fixed dependency check for prerequisite
      Algorithm::Diff (#7340).
    * Produce correct output when a diff chunk is precisely '0'
      (#6756).
    * Install the htmldiff tool into your bin directory on make 
      install (#7341).
    * Fixed some bugs where html_word_diff gave the wrong flag for a
      chunk (e.g. ['+', 'b', 'b c']).

0.55, April 27, 2004:
    * Fixed a problem where some "same" chunks were considered
      "different."  This occured if you had container tags that used
      uppercase letters.
    * First element of result always contained a 'different' chunk
      between undef values. It's now suppressed.

0.54, June 15, 2003:
    * Following XTHML spec, added all the "single" (unclosable) tags, such
      as IMG, BASE, LINK, etc. to the list of such tags used by the module.
    * Converted this list into an exposed package variable, so that 
      push @HTML::Diff::UNBALANCED_TAGS, $new_tag_name allows you to modify
      the list of "single" tags.

0.52, April 17, 2003:
    * Switched to Makefile.PL, thereby fixing broken tests.

v0.51, April 16, 2003:
    * Added htmldiff script contributed by Maurice Aubrey.

v0.5, March 31, 2003 -- initial release
