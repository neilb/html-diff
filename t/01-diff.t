<strong>Abstract.</strong>
This report focuses on two core areas of theory of computing:
discrete algorithms and computational complexity theory.
The report 
reviews the purposes and goals of theoretical research,
summarizes selected past and recent achievements,
<i>explains the importance of</i> sustaining core research,
and identifies promising opportunities for future research.
Some research opportunities build bridges between
theory of computing and other areas of computer science,
and other science and engineering disciplines.
